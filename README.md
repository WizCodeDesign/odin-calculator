# odin-calculator  
<br/><br/>
This is an odin Project where I build a calculator that can add, subtract, divide and multiply numbers that the user inputs from prompt.<br/><br/>
When you press a button an action is taken, the user inputs the first number, then the operator, then the second number and finally you press equal to calculate your inputs and it displays on the calculator screen.<br/><br/>  
The clear all button, numbers, and operators buttons are all working but the functionality of backspace, 00, and clear buttons aren't complete.<br/><br/>

This project can be improved upon by reworking all my logic in script to make the operation variable present in all functions instead of it being global, so it can be changed according to each operation / funtion it passes through.<br/><br/>  
But I don't want to do this now, maybe later when I am more proficient in JavaScript and design patterns.
