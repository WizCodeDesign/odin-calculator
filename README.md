# odin-calculator  
<br/><br/>
This is an odin Project where I build a calculator that can add, subtract, divide and multiply numbers that the user inputs from prompt.<br/><br/>
When you press a button an action is taken, the user inputs the first number, then the operator, then the second number and finally you press equal to calculate your inputs and it displays on the calculator screen.
